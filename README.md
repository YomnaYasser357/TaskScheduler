# Mini Task Scheduler

## Overview
The **Mini Task Scheduler** is a simple console-based C++ application that allows users to manage tasks using a **priority queue**. Higher priority tasks will be handled first.

## Features
- **Add tasks** with a name and priority.
- **Complete tasks** by removing the highest-priority one.
- **Display all tasks** sorted by priority.
- **Simple console-based interface**.

## Technologies Used
- **C++** (Object-Oriented Programming)
- **Priority Queue** (Heap-based implementation)
- **File Handling (Future Improvement)**

## How to Run
1. **Compile the code:**
   ```bash
   g++ task_scheduler.cpp -o task_scheduler
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   ./task_scheduler
   ```
3. **Follow on-screen options to manage tasks.**

## Future Enhancements
- Add file storage to save and load tasks.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Support recurring tasks and due dates.
